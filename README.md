                            STUDENT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS SYSTEM USING MACHINELEARNING TEHNIQUES
                            
Educational institutions now a days are producing a vast amount of data that can be analysed to enhance the status of the present day education system. Such data when organised in a well defined manner can be used to predict values that help in the improvement of a studentâ€™s performance. Student Performance Analysis System (SPAS) facilitates students to enhance  their career opportunities using results. Based on the predictions made by the system the students can be encouraged and guided by mentors to improve their scores which in turn increases the performance of the class. SPAS show cases the importance of data analysis in the field of education system and how it helps in improving the system as a whole. The main idea of the project relies on using Decision tree classifier algorithm in supervised learning.Student dataset is input to SPAS that contains labelled data and from which grades are predicted with at most accuracy. The outcome of the SPAS is pictorial representation of grades per subject.
